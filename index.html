            <h1>Amazing Workplace</h1>

            <small>By Mahmudul Hasan</small>

            <p>We asked our staff four simple questions about what constituted an amazing workplace for them.
            Interestingly the most common thread across all answers and all questions is around the workplace culture.
            So people expect the hygiene factors of a pleasant environment to be met and when asked the question their
            thoughts turned to people and culture aspects of work along with flexible policies.Our staff want to feel proud,
            happy and energised in a friendly and fun environment where they are valued for their ideas and work and feel part
            of a whole team. Flexible working policies feature highly with a work-life balance featuring in many different ways.</p>

            <h3>Our Workplace</h3>

            <p>When managers create a safe environment to express ideas and make suggestions, employees are more likely to
            think their workplace is innovative. Workplaces that have innovative cultures inspire employee loyalty, confidence and
            willingness to give extra. Employees at innovative companies are more likely to say theyâ€™re proud to tell others they
            work there.</p>
